* How the function signatures are generated

: $ tools/gensigs.sh

This takes the file =/usr/include/ncursesw/ncurses.h=, runs it through
the C preprocessor (with some judiciously chosen =#defines=) then
processes the output with =gentypes.rb=. The output file
=functions.rb= is then copied to =lib/ffi-ncurses/functions.rb= which
is =require=d at the top of =lib/ffi-ncurses.rb=.

** Step by step
Preprocess =ncurses.h=:

: cpp -DNCURSES_NOMACROS -imacros stdio.h /usr/include/ncurses.h > output2.h

For =ncursesw=:

: cpp -DNCURSES_NOMACROS -DNCURSES_OPAQUE -D_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED -imacros stdio.h -imacros wchar.h $INPUT_FILE \

Strip out =#line= numbers and blank lines:

: | egrep -v "^\s*$" | grep -v "^#" > stage1.h

Generate FFI signatures:

: ruby gentypes.rb stage1.h > functions.rb 2>unmapped-functions.rb

* wchar_t vs wint_t

wchar_t usually narrower than wint_t (which has to hold values outside
the character range, e.g. WEOF - cf. char type and EOF in int)
