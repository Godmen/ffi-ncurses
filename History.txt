= Changelog for ffi-ncurses

== 0.4.0 / 2011-09-25

* Supports all functions in ncursesw except the =vwprintw/vwscanw=
  family.
* Added =ACS= constants (box characters). See =examples/acs.rb= and
  =examples/wacs.rb=.
* Added support for =libpanelw=. See =examples/panel_simple.rb=.
* Better examples. See =examples/viewer.rb= for a simple but complete
  file viewing application.
* Methods with boolean arguments now =true= or =false= as well as 1 or
  0.
* Start of a compatibility layer for the existing C extension-based
  Ncurses Ruby libraries - require 'ffi-ncurses/ncurses'.  Runs all
  the examples from ncurses-ruby without changes (except those relying
  on menus and forms). See =examples/ncurses/*.rb=.
* Sets the locale (using FFI::Locale.setlocale(LC_ALL, "")) in ruby
  1.8.x to enable UTF-8 input. See =examples/getkey.rb= to see how to
  distinguish between function keys and Unicode characters.
