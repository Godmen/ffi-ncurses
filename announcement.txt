ffi-ncurses version 0.3.1
    by Sean O'Halpin
    http://github.com/seanohalpin/ffi-ncurses

== DESCRIPTION

A wrapper for ncurses 5.x. Tested on Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) and Ubuntu
8.04 with ruby 1.8.6 using ruby-ffi (>= 0.2.0) and JRuby 1.1.6.

The API is very much a transliteration of the C API rather than an
attempt to provide an idiomatic Ruby object-oriented API. The intent
is to provide a 'close to the metal' wrapper around the ncurses
library upon which you can build your own abstractions.

See the examples directory for real working examples.

== CHANGES

* Bug fix:
  * Removed dependency on ffi (so gem will install in JRuby)
